# My Curriculum Vitae

This repository contains my curriculum vitae.

No more, no less.

## Why

As a software engineer, I wanted my CV to follow my professional practices :

* Source text based to easily use SCMs, merging, diffing, history
* Publicly available, shareable, editable
* HTML W3C compliant but also PDF format to ease reading

I also wanted to (re)-learn some basics of the front [(and back)][8] end
development, using a task runner, livereload, and other facilities.

Ruby is also used because, it is just **fun** to
combine heterogenous tools.

## What

* Content of the CV is in
[YAML format][1].
* HTML and PDF rendered versions can also be found here :
  * [HTML version](./src/export/cv.html)
  * PDF version (not available yet)
* Rendering from YAML to HTML is done with [HAML engine][2]
* This is mainly a fork of [hoogeveen/cv](https://github.com/hoogeveen/cv), thanks for this great work !

## How

### Easy method : [Docker][6] and [Compose][7]

[Docker][6] is used to make the packaging easy and portable
[Compose][7] will take care of mounting files, forwarding ports, etc.

Ensure you have [Docker][6] and [Compose][7] clients
configured to reach a working Docker Engine

Then, just run  to launch the [Gulp][5] process :

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Open you browser to the page, using your Docker Engine IP :

```text
http://<YOUR DOCKER ENGINE IP>:4000
```

### Not-so-easy method : Local Gulp and local Bundler

> TIP : the Dockerfile is a good idea to understand
> how to do that.

If you know your way with [Gulp][5], [NPM][3], and [Bundler](4)
or just do not want to use [Docker][6],
you should follow those instructions in the right order :

1. Install [NPM][3]. We use it to manage dependencies.

1. Then you need a [Ruby Bundler installation][4]
to manage dependencies of Ruby Gem
with this command :

```bash
# With Ruby and Bundler installed
bundle install
...
```

1. Then you can bootstrap dependencies with [NPM][3] :

```bash
# Will install all the dev. modules locally
npm install
...
```

1. [Gulp][5] is used as workflow engine by running tasks :

```bash
gulp
# It runs the default tasks that renders, serves pages
# with live-reload enabled
```

1. Open your browser to <http://localhost:4000>

## Deploying

The folder `./src/export` :

* Is not stored inside git (cf `.gitignore`)
* Is both generated and served by the [Gulp][5] workflow

If you want to deploy the content of this folder to another directory,
just mount it with [docker-compose][7] and provide and environment variable.

For example, using [docker-compose extending feature](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/) :

1. Create a file name ```docker-compose.override.yml``` at the repository root
(note that this file will not be git-tracked for security reasons) :

```yml
gulp-server:
    volumes:
      - ~/some/folder:/folder/to/deploy
    environment:
      - DEPLOY_DIR=/folder/to/deploy
```

1. Then, just call the gulp ```deploy```target :

```bash
docker-compose run gulp-server deploy
```

1. OR run ```gulp deploy```if you are in local mode:

```bash
DEPLOY_DIR=~/some/folder gulp deploy
```
